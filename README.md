## Frontend (Client-Side):

### HTML5 + CSS3: 
For creating the game layout and user interface.

### JavaScript + Node.js + Express:

Node.js is used in conjunction with express to run the frontend server - retrieving and displaying all stock information in real time. 

### WebSockets:

WebSockets enable real-time interaction between the client and server. This would ensure that the stock prices and trades are updated instantly for all players.

### HTML5 Canvas: 
For rendering dynamic, interactive stock market graphs, avatars, and real-time transactions.

## Backend (Server-Side):

### Node.js: 
It‚Äôs a non-blocking, event-driven architecture that handles real-time multiplayer games well, especially when paired with WebSockets.

### Express.js: 
A lightweight framework that allows for set up of REST APIs. However, in this project it is used to serve environment variables to the front end through HTML injection.

### WebSocket Server (Socket.IO):

Socket.IO (with Node.js) is great for handling real-time communication, allowing players to see market changes, trade results, and interact with others instantly.

Players' actions like buying/selling stocks should be sent to the server using WebSockets, and the server will push the changes back to all players in real-time.

### API Backend (Django + Django REST Framework):

Django will manage the core business logic (player management, transaction handling, etc.) and interact with PostgreSQL to store and retrieve data.

Django REST Framework will expose API endpoints for the frontend to interact with the database (e.g., fetching stock data, updating player portfolios, storing transactions).

### Authentication (Django JWT):

The authentication system in Django will handle user login, registration, and management.

### Database (postgreSQL):

PostgreSQL can handle large amounts of data and complex queries efficiently, making it a solid choice for multiplayer games with real-time data.

## Dev Tools (VS Code, Git):
VS Code: The IDE with the tools for front-end & back-end development. With extensions for both Djano and Node.js.

Git: Use Git for version control.

## Game Design Considerations:

### Stock Trading Mechanic: 
In the game, players can buy/sell stocks from various companies (real or fictional). The prices fluctuate based on market conditions (simulated in-game), and players aim to maximize their portfolios by making profitable trades. Real-time market changes should create tension, making the trading environment dynamic.

### Levels & Leaderboards: 
Players can start with a small amount of capital and try to grow their wealth over time. As they level up, they can unlock more stocks, access to advanced trading features, and higher-level strategies. There should be a leaderboard where players are ranked based on their level gained which is decided by amount of profit made/shares bought. The users experience gained from buying shares reduces dynamically from level increase.

### Market Events: 
Occasionally, the stock market is affected by random in-game events, like a "market crash," "global financial crisis," or "IPO hype," which shake things up and affect all players. These events are triggered randomly.

---

## Scalability Considerations

### Distributed Servers: 
There may be a need to scale the game server horizontally to handle a large number of concurrent players.

### Load Balancing: 
A load balancer could distribute requests across multiple game servers, ensuring that no single server becomes overwhelmed.

### Real-time Data Handling: 
Since stock trading is heavily reliant on real-time updates, consideration of optimization of WebSocket connections for low-latency communication.

## Challenges of Implementing a Real-Time Simulated Stock Market Using a Sine Wave Algorithm
Designing a real-time stock market simulation using a sine wave algorithm to dictate price fluctuations may seem appealing due to its predictable, smooth oscillation, but it introduces several technical and gameplay-related difficulties:

### 1. Predictability

A sine wave follows a mathematically predictable pattern, making it possible for players to "time the market" and game the system by predicting when prices will rise or fall.

Consequence: This undermines the challenge and realism of trading. It turns the game into a pattern-recognition task rather than strategic decision-making under uncertainty.

### 2. Lack of Realism

Real-world stock markets are influenced by complex, often random variables: news events, earnings reports, political shifts, etc. A sine wave provides perfect symmetry and rhythm, which feels artificial.

Consequence: Players may find the market behavior too mechanical, hurting immersion and replayability.

### 3. Synchronization Complexity
In a multiplayer environment using WebSockets, synchronizing sine wave-driven prices across all clients requires precise time coordination. Even small desynchronizations between client clocks and server ticks can lead to price discrepancies.

Consequence: Real-time trading could break if users are acting on slightly different price data, leading to fairness issues and bugs.

### 4. Difficulty Simulating Volatility and News Events
A sine wave has a constant frequency and amplitude unless artificially modified. Introducing realistic volatility spikes, crashes, or news-induced market shifts requires layering additional noise or event triggers on top of the wave.

Consequence: This increases complexity and may require building a custom hybrid algorithm that blends deterministic and random behavior.

### 5. Inflexibility in Scaling Complexity
As the game gets more complex, there is a need to simulate different sectors or stocks reacting independently. A basic sine wave doesn‚Äôt account for correlation between stocks, volume pressure, or divergent market behavior.

Consequence: Using sine waves can limit future development of advanced trading mechanics and nuanced market conditions.

### 6. Server Performance Load
Continuously calculating and broadcasting stock prices in real time (especially for many assets using sine functions + noise) can become CPU-intensive, particularly under high player load.

Consequence: Without efficient computation and throttling strategies, it can impact backend performance and increase latency.

### ‚úîÔ∏è Potential Solutions
To mitigate the above issues:

Combine sine waves with random noise and event-based modifiers to introduce unpredictability.

Use server-side timestamping to maintain synchronized price states across clients.

Periodically regenerate parameters (e.g., amplitude, frequency) to make cycles less predictable.

Layer in game-driven events to break regularity.

---

## üìå Development Phases

### Prototype:

Focus on developing the core mechanics (real-time stock trading, market events).

Implement the trading interface and core stock price simulation.

### Multiplayer Integration:

Set up a basic multiplayer framework using WebSockets (Socket.IO) to handle player interactions.

### Backend & Database Integration:

Set up a database to store player profiles, stock transactions, and market data.

### UI Design & Polishing:

Work on creating an intuitive and engaging user interface that includes charts, trade options, and player profiles.

### Testing & Launch:

Test for bugs, scalability, and balance. After the testing phase, release the game and ensure that the servers are optimized for a large number of concurrent players.
