## üß∞ Tech Stack

| Layer        | Technology                   |
|--------------|-------------------------------|
| Frontend     | HTML, CSS, JavaScript        |
| Game Server  | Node.js + Express             |
| API Backend  | Django + Django REST Framework|
| WebSockets   | Socket.IO                     |
| Database     | PostgreSQL                    |
| Auth         | Django JWT |
| Dev Tools    | VS Code, Git |

## Frontend (Client-Side):

### HTML5 + CSS3: 
For creating the game layout and user interface.

### JavaScript + Node.js + Express:

Node.js is used in conjunction with express to run the frontend server - retrieving and displaying all stock information in real time. 

### WebSockets:

WebSockets enable real-time interaction between the client and server. This would ensure that the stock prices and trades are updated instantly for all players.

### HTML5 Canvas: 
For rendering dynamic, interactive stock market graphs, avatars, and real-time transactions.

## Backend (Server-Side):

### Node.js: 
It‚Äôs a non-blocking, event-driven architecture that handles real-time multiplayer games well, especially when paired with WebSockets.

### Express.js: 
A lightweight framework that allows for set up of REST APIs. However, in this project it is used to serve environment variables to the front end through HTML injection.

### WebSocket Server (Socket.IO):

Socket.IO (with Node.js) is great for handling real-time communication, allowing players to see market changes, trade results, and interact with others instantly.

Players' actions like buying/selling stocks should be sent to the server using WebSockets, and the server will push the changes back to all players in real-time.

### API Backend (Django + Django REST Framework):

Django will manage the core business logic (player management, transaction handling, etc.) and interact with PostgreSQL to store and retrieve data.

Django REST Framework will expose API endpoints for the frontend to interact with the database (e.g., fetching stock data, updating player portfolios, storing transactions).

### Authentication (Django JWT):

The authentication system in Django will handle user login, registration, and management.

### Database (postgreSQL):

PostgreSQL can handle large amounts of data and complex queries efficiently, making it a solid choice for multiplayer games with real-time data.

## Dev Tools (VS Code, Git):
VS Code: The IDE with the tools for front-end & back-end development. With extensions for both Djano and Node.js.

Git: Use Git for version control.

## Game Design Considerations:

### Stock Trading Mechanic: 
In the game, players can buy/sell stocks from various companies (real or fictional). The prices fluctuate based on market conditions (simulated in-game), and players aim to maximize their portfolios by making profitable trades. Real-time market changes should create tension, making the trading environment dynamic.

### Levels & Leaderboards: 
Players can start with a small amount of capital and try to grow their wealth over time. As they level up, they can unlock more stocks, access to advanced trading features, and higher-level strategies. There should be a leaderboard where players are ranked based on their level gained which is decided by amount of profit made/shares bought. The users experience gained from buying shares reduces dynamically from level increase.

### Market Events: 
Occasionally, the stock market is affected by random in-game events, like a "market crash," "global financial crisis," or "IPO hype," which shake things up and affect all players. These events are triggered randomly.

---

## Scalability Considerations

### Distributed Servers: 
There may be a need to scale the game server horizontally to handle a large number of concurrent players.

### Load Balancing: 
A load balancer could distribute requests across multiple game servers, ensuring that no single server becomes overwhelmed.

### Real-time Data Handling: 
Since stock trading is heavily reliant on real-time updates, consideration of optimization of WebSocket connections for low-latency communication.

---

## Security Considerations

### Secret Key Obfuscation:
Using .gitignore and environment varaiables to properly ensure the security of the services needed and mantain the web application.

### Password Hashing:
Performing a password hash when committing data the database - in this project I have used SHA256.

### JWT Authentication:
JWT's are stateless and self contained - being digitally signed with a hashing method such as SHA256. They can be verified with just the signature and public key, reducing server-side storage needs and reducing database load. 

---

## üìå Development Phases

### Prototype:

Focus on developing the core mechanics (real-time stock trading, market events).

Implement the trading interface and core stock price simulation.

### Multiplayer Integration:

Set up a basic multiplayer framework using WebSockets (Socket.IO) to handle player interactions.

### Backend & Database Integration:

Set up a database to store player profiles, stock transactions, and market data.

### UI Design & Polishing:

Work on creating an intuitive and engaging user interface that includes charts, trade options, and player profiles.

### Testing & Launch:

Test for bugs, scalability, and balance. After the testing phase, release the game and ensure that the servers are optimized for a large number of concurrent players.
